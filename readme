The tomcat server is at /usr/share/apache-tomcat-7.0.56. The running script are in the bin folder (/usr/share/apache-tomcat-7.0.56/bin). Use sh catalina.sh start/stop to start or stop the website. If you want to see the exceptions (and I see some null pointer exceptions) in the console, you can use the command sh catalina.sh run

The mysql server is located at /var/lib/mysql. I don't know why the software is using it, but I see that some parts of the code make a connection to it and there are some tables there. You can connect to mysql using the command mysql -u root -h -localhost -p (no password for root). Once connected, you can use the command show tables to see the list of tables or write sql commands to query the tables.

The Triple store is a Jena Fuseki server. The Fuseki server itself is located at /mnt/storage/jena-fuseki-1.1.1, but the TDB files (44GB) are at /mnt/storage/tdb_integrated_dbpedia. To bring up the Jena Fuseki server, go to the directory /mnt/storage/jena-fuseki-1.1.1 and execute the command: sh fuseki-server --loc=/mnt/storage/tdb_integrated_dbpedia/ --port=3030 /integrated_dbpedia &. You can use the command sh fuseki-server --help  to find more information. The code connects to the server using the link http://lodstories.isi.edu:3030/integrated_dbpedia/query (AbstractFinderServlet.java). So, you need to bring it up on port 3030 and use the database name integrated_dbpedia since it is hard coded. Once you started the server, you can use the link http://lodstories.isi.edu:3030 to access to the Fuseki web interface, where you can select the Control Panel, select the database, and easily run SPARQL queries in a web interface (Try that now!).

Unfortunately, there is no automatic start up for the Fuseki server, and this is bad because it will die if the server restarts. You need to write a service to start this process whenever the server restarts. It is easy, you can google it. Basically, you should write a service that executes the command sh fuseki-server --loc=/mnt/storage/tdb_integrated_dbpedia/ --port=3030 /integrated_dbpedia, and the put the service in a specific folder (I think /etc/init.d/).
